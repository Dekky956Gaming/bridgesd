          <p>
            Conor Bridges was born August 16th 2008. He goes to school at Bayridge Secondary School as a grade 9. He lives with his two siblings, his grandparents, and his mother in a house north of Kingston. He spends most of his time Playing Video Games, working out, hanging out with friends, learning to cook, music, and playing with Jasper. His favorite color is orange and he is an extremely intellegent specimen. His life acomplishments are: Raising Hamsters, Getting Married in Fortnite, graduating grade 8, meeting jack veech. He is in the BCSP, Minecraft Club, ESports club, Dungeons and Dragon club, and the yearbook club. Some of his high skills would include: trumpet skills, gaming prowess, raw strength, extreme sense of humour, great music taste. He is also a good baseball player, who has been on hiatus since covid. I will be going more indepth on his skills and daily activities on the other pages.
